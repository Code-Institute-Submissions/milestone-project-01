## An introduction to the project

The Studes is a co-working space that will encourage **collaboration** and **communication** between professional artists, makers, crafts people, designers and digital creatives as well as enthusiasts who just need a space for their creative outlet.
The Studes will opening soon in Stockholm and will offer flexible membership packages and pay-as-you-go facilities to its members.
For its launch, The Studes requires a website that will feel like a creative destination and serve the following purposes:
1. Somewhere for people to join
2. Somewhere for existing members to book facilities and reach out to other members
3. Somewhere for visitors to get in touch.

For those who are considering joining, the website will display the different membership packages and lead the user to an application page.
For existing members, the website will host a page where members can book facilities - such as a photographic studio or desk space. On the same page, members will also be able to communicate to other members with collaboration ideas, commissions and other creative opportunities. 

## UX

### Site Users - who is it focused on
- The Studes website is geared towards people living in the Stockholm area, who are either professional creatives needing a space to work or hobbyists who need a space to indulge their creative passions.
- The main users of the site will be either:

    - ### **New Joiners**
    - People curious about becoming a member of The Studes and wanting more information about the membership packages.
    - People who want to join and are ready to apply. 

    - ### ***Existing Members**
    - Members who need to book facilities and want to enquire about availability.
    - Members who want to communicate with other members. They could have an idea for collaborating, a possible commission or another creative idea.

- Both groups are looking for somewhere that they can be creative without having the big financial commitment and hassle associated with having their own private studio.
- The users of the site will be mainly existing members or people who are interested in joining (and either want to find out more or are there to apply for membership).
- Both groups are associated with a creative field and want to meet and possibly collaborate with other creatives in the Stockholm area.
