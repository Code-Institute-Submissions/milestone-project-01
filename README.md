## An introduction to the project

The Studes is a co-working space that will encourage **collaboration** and **communication** between professional artists, makers, crafts people, designers and digital creatives as well as enthusiasts who just need a space for their creative outlet.
The Studes will opening soon in Stockholm and will offer flexible membership packages and pay-as-you-go facilities to its members.
For its launch, The Studes requires a website that will feel like a creative destination and serve the following purposes:
1. Somewhere for people to join
2. Somewhere for existing members to book facilities and reach out to other members
3. Somewhere for people to get in touch.

For those who are considering joining, the website will display the different membership packages and lead the user to an application page.
For existing members, the website will host a page where members can book facilities - such as a photographic studio or desk space. On the same page, members will also be able to communicate to other members with collaboration ideas, commissions and other creative opportunities. 

## UX

### Site Users - who is it focused on?
- The Studes website is geared towards people living in the Stockholm area, who are either professional creatives needing a space to work or hobbyists who need a space to indulge their creative passions.
- The main users of the site will be either:

    - ### **New Joiners**
    - People curious about becoming a member of The Studes and wanting more information about the membership packages.
    - People who want to join and are ready to apply. 

    - ### **Existing Members**
    - Members who need to book facilities and want to enquire about availability.
    - Members who want to collaborate and communicate with other members. They could have an idea for collaborating, a possible commission or another creative idea.

- Both of the main groups have a need for a space where they can be creative without having the financial commitments and hassle of having their own private studio. 
- The site will also be a source of information for people who just need to know contact details or are curious about what The Studes is.

### User Stories
1. John, “I'm a sculptor and need to create some pieces next week. The Studes has a dirty area that's perfect for artists with all the equipment. I need to check if I can use it on a certain day next week.” 
2. Sabrina, “I’m a student at the craft school and live in a small shared flat so aren’t able to do much work at home. I’d love a studio of my own but that would be quite expensive and I don’t want to spend that much just for a few evenings a week. I’ve heard about The Studes so want to see if membership is affordable and if it's not too much, I want to join!”
3. Tony, “I’ve heard about The Studes and just want to check it out. I used to screen print when I was younger and am considering taking it up again but don’t have any materials. I want to see how much it costs to be a member, and maybe reach out to someone to teach me?”
4. Isabelle, “I’m a womenswear designer that uses The Studes for their big tables, sewing machines and to generally make a mess! I’m working for a client who wants bespoke prints designed but I can’t do it myself. I need to see if there is anyone at The Studes who does print and would be interested in working with me on this collection”
5. Alex, “Someone left their ‘The Studes’ bag with some materials in it at my coffee shop. I just need a phone number so they can pick it up”

The background image is a fixed position and does not repeat. 
The bold text is responsive and changes size in smaller screens.
