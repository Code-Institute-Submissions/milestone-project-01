# Milestone Project 1 - A website for The Studes

# Link to website?
## An introduction to the project

The Studes is a co-working space that will encourage **collaboration** and **communication** between professional artists, makers, crafts people, designers and digital creatives as well as enthusiasts who just need a space for their creative outlet.
The Studes will opening soon in Stockholm and will offer flexible membership packages and pay-as-you-go facilities to its members.
For its launch, The Studes requires a website that will feel like a creative destination and serve the following purposes:
1. Somewhere for people to join
2. Somewhere for existing members to book facilities and reach out to other members
3. Somewhere for people to get in touch.

For those who are considering joining, the website will display the different membership packages and lead the user to an application page.
For existing members, the website will host a page where members can book facilities - such as a photographic studio or desk space. On the same page, members will also be able to communicate to other members with collaboration ideas, commissions and other creative opportunities. 

## UX

### Site Users - who is it focused on?
- The Studes website is geared towards people living in the Stockholm area, who are either professional creatives needing a space to work or hobbyists who need a space to indulge their creative passions.
- The main users of the site will be either:

    - ### **New Joiners**
    - People curious about becoming a member of The Studes and wanting more information about the membership packages.
    - People who want to join and are ready to apply. 

    - ### **Existing Members**
    - Members who need to book facilities and want to enquire about availability.
    - Members who want to collaborate and communicate with other members. They could have an idea for collaborating, a possible commission or another creative idea.

- Both of the main groups have a need for a space where they can be creative without having the financial commitments and hassle of having their own private studio. 
- The site will also be a source of information for people who just need to know contact details or are curious about what The Studes is.

### User Stories
1. John, “I'm a sculptor and need to create some pieces next week. The Studes has a dirty area that's perfect for artists with all the equipment. I need to check if I can use it on a certain day next week.” 
2. Sabrina, “I’m a student at the craft school and live in a small shared flat so aren’t able to do much work at home. I’d love a studio of my own but that would be quite expensive and I don’t want to spend that much just for a few evenings a week. I’ve heard about The Studes so want to see if membership is affordable and if it's not too much, I want to join!”
3. Tony, “I’ve heard about The Studes and just want to check it out. I used to screen print when I was younger and am considering taking it up again but don’t have any materials. I want to see how much it costs to be a member, and maybe reach out to someone to teach me?”
4. Isabelle, “I’m a womenswear designer that uses The Studes for their big tables, sewing machines and to generally make a mess! I’m working for a client who wants bespoke prints designed but I can’t do it myself. I need to see if there is anyone at The Studes who does print and would be interested in working with me on this collection”
5. Alex, “Someone left their ‘The Studes’ bag with some materials in it at my coffee shop. I just need a phone number so they can pick it up”

### The Studes website is the best way for users to achieve their goals because:

- Fonts are clear and readable, to aid accessibility through high contrast. 
- It provides users who are interested in membership, information about The Studes and its different membership packages.

- It provides members with a way of communicating with other members.
- Every page clearly displays The Studes email address and there are clear contact details for anyone who needs to make contact.

## Features

Each page features a **navigation bar** and **footer**.
The navigation bar contains the **logo** in the top left hand corner with the 4 menu items aligned to the right: home, join us, members, contact.
The Studes will contain a **live email button** and the **Instagram** and **LinkedIn icons** (since The Studes will only have social media presence on these 2 sites).
The header and footer contain only essential information, presented with clean fonts and with high contrast backgrounds to aid accessibility.

Each page also features a header panel that contains a hero background image related to The Studes business.
The header panels on every page also contain a bold heading and sub-heading copy that introduces that page, apart from the home page which has an abstract definition of The Studes to create intrigue. 

### Home Page
The home page features a header panel with a striking background image of a warehouse studio space and a definition of 'studes' in bold white text.
This provides an impactful first impression of the website. 
The background image is a fixed position and does not repeat. The bold text is responsive and changes size in smaller screens.
The word 'studes' acts as the page heading and should always be bigger than the definition, which is the sub-heading. 

Below the header panel is a short paragraph with an introduction to the concept of The Studes next to an image of a photoraphy studio setup. This reinforces the type of facilities available.
This image will move below the introduction paragraph on a screen smaller than a tablet.
Below the copy is a **button** which acts as a shortcut to find out more about different membership packages.

Underneath the introduction paragraph and image, sits a second paragraph and image that introduce the facilities for members and the idea of collaboration.
As both the paragraphs in this section relate to membership, there is a **button** that can take users directly to the members page.
The image that sits on the left is of some Apple computers in a modern office which give a suggestion of what The Studes will feel like.

Beneath this section sit four short testimonials and images of existing members.
There are two testimonials per row in a large screen, however in a small screen they will reduce to one testimonial per row and take up the width of the screen.
In a small screen, a dividing bar will appear between each testimonial to aid readability. 

### Join Us Page
The join us page features a header panel follows the same approach with a creative, striking image with bold white heading and sub-heading overlaid.
The image is centred and in a fixed position.

On the left hand side below the header panel sits an image of a photographic studio, to showcase the available facilities. 
Next to the image on the right are some key benefits of membership, with key words in bold to draw attention to them. 
On a large screen the image and the text will sit side by side, whereas a screen smaller than a tablet the image will sit below the text.

Beneath this section sit the membership packages. These are stripped back to the essential information to help the user process the information.
There are two membership types per row (four altogether), with an image on each row. The image is on the right hand side of the first row and on the left hand side of the second row.
Underneath each membership breakdown sits a **button that takes the user to the Application Form page**. 
On a tablet the images will disappear and the boxes will have a coloured background to aid visibility and distinguish between each other.
On a small screen the memberships will become stacked. 

### Application Form Page
For consistency across the site, this page features a header panel with a creative image and text.

Beneath this sits a form where the user can apply for membership. Elements within the form include:
- **Buttons to select the type of membership** the user would like to apply for, with a reminder sentence below. (If they need a more detailed reminder, there is a button to take them back to the joining page with more information)
- The **form** requests full name, email address and a link to portfolio.
- The form also requests for the user to enter their specialist creative area.
- The **submit button** opens a modal to confirm the user's application has been sent and The Studes will be in touch soon. The buttons in the modal give the user the option to close or go back to the home page.

### Members Page
Beneath the header panel the user has the option to **enquire about availability** and also to **share a commission or collaboration brief** with The Studes network.

The first form features brief text on the left of the page, explaining the purpose of the form and expected next steps. 
The user must then fill in the following information on the right hand side of the page:
- Email address to identify the member.
- Which facility the user would like to book, which date and what time they would like to book. These 3 pieces of information are drop down menus to help them make a decision.
- If the user needs to book something for longer, they can explain their requirement below to avoid submitting multiple forms.
- There is then a **button** at the bottom which opens a **modal** to submit their booking request. This confirms their enquiry has been sent and gives them the option to take them back to the home page.

Underneath this form is another form where the user can share a collaboration or commission brief. 
As with the previous form, there is a brief text on the left explaining the purpose of the firm and next steps with the form on the right hand side.
The user must fill in the following:
- Email address.
- The type of enquiry, all as drop down options:
    - collaboration
    - commission
    - skill required
- A short written brief.
- There is then a **button** at the bottom to submit the brief which opens a **modal** and also confirms their brief has been received with an option to take them back to the home page. 

### Contact Page
This page features essential contact information with a **Google map** on the left, with contact information on the right.

The contact information box features a **live link** to open the email address in a new window, a **call function** when the telephone number is clicked as well as an **Instagram link** to open The Studes Instagram stories when you click on the text.
The text is larger than the rest of the copy and a different font to draw attention to it, but doesn't use a button design.
The text overlays a creative themed image, which becomes a solid background in a mobile device to aid accessibility. 

On a screen tablet size and larger the map and contact information are side by side. Anything below tablet size the map and contact information are stacked.

### Features To Implement
- A login system for existing members. This will allow members to enter login details and omit the need to enter an email address when booking / enquiring / sending a brief
- A booking system which that would enable existing members to see the availability of facilities and book without assistance
- A 'noticeboard' for members to post collaboration ideas, briefs, commissions etc and interact with each other on the site
- An option to choose the language of the site. We are relying on everyone to speak English but want to ensure nobody is alienated
