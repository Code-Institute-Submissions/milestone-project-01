## An introduction to the project

The Studes is a co-working space that will encourage **collaboration** and **communication** between professional artists, makers, crafts people, designers and digital creatives as well as enthusiasts who just need a space for their creative outlet.
The Studes will opening soon in Stockholm and will offer flexible membership packages and pay-as-you-go facilities to its members.
For its launch, The Studes requires a website that will feel like a creative destination and serve the following purposes:
1. Somewhere for people to join
2. Somewhere for existing members to book facilities and reach out to other members
3. Somewhere for visitors to get in touch.

For those who are considering joining, the website will display the different membership packages and lead the user to an application page.
For existing members, the website will host a page where members can book facilities - such as a photographic studio or desk space. On the same page, members will also be able to communicate to other members with collaboration ideas, commissions and other creative opportunities.
