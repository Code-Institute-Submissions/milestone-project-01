## Testing client stories from the UX section of README.md

- The user is then able to fill in the form to match their requirements

2. "I’m a student at the craft school and live in a small shared flat so aren’t able to do much work at home.
I’d love a studio of my own but that would be quite expensive and I don’t want to spend that much just for a few evenings a week. 
**I’ve heard about The Studes so want to see if membership is affordable and if it's not too much, I want to join!**"
- This user is not currently a member of The Studes so may be unfamiliar with the site.
